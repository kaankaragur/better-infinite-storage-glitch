# Better Infinite Storage Glitch (In alpha, generally broken)

Here is a general summary of this repository.

## First of all, this is a remake.

Big shoutout to the [Owner of The Idea](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch) for the beautiful idea.
That's a remake version. It uses Python and Encodes with Base64. Moreover, it uses AI for lower file sizes (EXPERIMENTAL).

## What is this for?

There is a new glitch that you can have infinite storage by converting files into videos and uploading them to YouTube.
The main goal is to remake it with a stable language and add more features.

## How is it work?

It assigns random RGB numbers for base64 characters and uses AI to make colors unique to reduce losses (Still in development).

# Most importantly:

All for educational purposes, that was a fun project. Also, that was fun.
